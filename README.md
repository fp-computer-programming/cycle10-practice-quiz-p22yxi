### Answer each part of the following question in the same python file named `cycle-10_practice-quiz.py` In your heading, put your name and the date you began working on the file. ALL QUESTIONS SHOULD BE COMMENTED THROUGHOUT THE CODE

---

1) Copy the code below. complete the function below using enumerate to make the print statement true

def food_costs(groceries,costs):
    groceries_mod = groceries
    
    return groceries_mod

print(food_costs(['apple','pear','banana',],['salmon','tuna','cod',],['milk','eggs','yogurt',],[1.99,2.99,0.99,9.99,10.99,6.99,3.49,2.49,1.49]) == 
['apple: $1.99','pear: $2.99','banana: $0.99',],['salmon: $9.99','tuna: $10.99','cod:$6.99',],['milk: $3.49','eggs: $2.49','yogurt: $1.49',])

2) write a function that uses a loop to find the factorial of a given number. Test cases are included below for you.

HINT: a factorial is the product of all **positive** integers between one and the given integer. e.i. the factorial of 5 is 1*2*3*4*5

3) The Fibonacci Sequence is a series of numbers. The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it. The first two numbers are 0 and 1. For example, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. The next number in this series above is 13+21 = 34.

write a program that accepts a number as a parameter. The program should return an array of numbers in the fibbonacci sequence until the length of the array matches the number passed into function.

examples

fib_nums(5) == [0,1,1,2,3]
fib_nums(10) == [0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34]
